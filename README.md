	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
	<p>Hey! Welcome to my blog/photography/one day hoping to be a web developer project site. I hope you enjoy watching my site grow into something awesome but also get inspired yourself to try something new, whether it's a new language, type of food, hobby, or shirt; I'm really hoping your attire changes daily guys. Thanks for visiting Extreme Roaming!</p>

   	<h2>Frankenstein Says Hello</h2>
	 <h3>March 25, 2019 8:45</h3>
    <p>I'm not really sure what I write as a title for these kinds of moments. I mean do we imagine Frankenstein waking up from his bolt of electricity and saying, "Hello World! Roar." I don't imagine so. I'm not saying this is my ugly creation because as soon as I'm done with this website, it'll be a thing of jealousy (not really but I'm hoping something close to it). This is my attempt to be relevant in the world. To be able to finally find a career that will let me travel and let me be me instead of being trapped at a desk for 8 grueling hours or have only one option for work (cough cough teaching little beings). I hope that project turns out well for, I guess, both of us. You, as a viewer, receive hopefully a pretty well functioning website that you will enjoy and will come back to and I have something to bust up my skills. This means change will happen often. I apologize now for those of you who just like words on a white screen. Honestly, you need some more spice in your life anyway. Anyway, welcome to my website/blog/photography page. I hope you all enjoy seeing the progress. I will post every-so-often just to keep you abreast on all thats new and cool in my journey, not only as a coder but also just as an ex-pat. Bye for now!</p>
