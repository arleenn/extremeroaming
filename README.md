            <h1>Frankenstein Says Hello</h1>
                <h2>March 25, 2019 20:45</h2>
                    <p>I'm not really sure what I write as a title for these kinds of moments.
                        mean do we imagine Frankenstein waking up from his bolt of electricity and saying, "Hello World! Roar." I don't imagine so.
                       I'm not saying this is my ugly creation because as soon as I'm done with this website, it'll be a thing of jealousy (not really 
                       but I'm hoping something close to it). 
                       This is my attempt to be relevant in the world. To be able to finally find a career that will let me travel and let me be me 
                       instead of being trapped at a desk for 8 grueling hours or have only one option for work (cough cough teaching little beings).
                       I hope that project turns out well for, I guess, both of us. You, as a viewer, receive hopefully a pretty well functioning 
                       website that you will enjoy and will come back to and I have something to bust up my skills. This means change will happen often.
                       I apologize now for those of you who just like words on a white screen. Honestly, you need some more spice in your life anyway.
                        Anyway, welcome to my website/blog/photography page. I hope you all enjoy seeing the progress.
                       I will post every-so-often just to keep you abreast on all thats new and cool in my journey, not only as a coder but also 
                       just as an ex-pat. Bye for now!
                       Taiwan is a very interesting place so I update my blog at least once a week. Make sure to check out all of the new photos 
                       and blog posts every week.</p>

                <h2>May 26, 2019 23:22</h2>
                    <p>So I feel really bad because I was supposed to update this thing every week but I've
                    already failed you guys. I am determined to do better. Lately, I have been relishing in the fact I have officially been living in 
                    Taiwan for one whole year (applause welcomed). That is one year of smelling stinky tofu every time I walk past the night market,
                    one year that I have experienced a full cycle of smoldering heat, and one full year of speaking Mandarin every single day. I feel very
                    accomplished but I also feel humbled. I have learned so much about myself and I feel that I will only keep growing from here. I have learned
                    that I actually need personal time to myself (who knew?!), I have also learned about my likes and dislikes. Although I had already been living 
                    on my own and working full time before coming to Taiwan, I felt that I was a wee little teenager still growing in myself. Now I feel like I have 
                    a handle on who I am and what I can take, what boundaries I can push without destroying my sanity. I have learned balance, how to deal with my anxiety,
                    and emotions. Reflecting on all of these things have really helped me see that moving to Taiwan was one of the best choices I could have ever made for
                    myself. I took a leap of faith because I knew I needed to change; I needed to learn who I was and I did. No matter what happens as I get older, this 
                    experience will forever be marked as the point I met me. </p>
